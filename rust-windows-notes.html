<p>It's easy enough to get started with Rust on a variety of platforms.
All are fairly similar.</p>

On Windows</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are using an existing code editor or IDE you are fond of,
look into how to set it up for Rust. (I use emacs, which works&#x2026; OK.)
There are great Rust tutorials online for most of these.</p>
<p>If in doubt, install Visual Studio Code from the Microsoft App Store.
Then install the official <code>Rust Analyzer</code> plugin from
rust-lang.org. Do not install any other Rust plugins at this stage:
there's some janky stuff floating around. There's some information on
setup at</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Now go to <a href="https://rustup.rs">https://rustup.rs</a> and
download and run <code>rustup.exe</code>. I know this is a bit scary,
but it is all well protected by PKI and will do nothing less benign than
install Rust on your machine via Rustup.</p>
<p>The installer will open a terminal and run on the command line: it is
fine to hit return and take the defaults for the install. Once the
installation completes, close the terminal, open a new terminal, and say
<code>rustc --version</code>. If all is well, you should see the version
number of the latest Rust.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now create new Rust programs and libraries with
<code>cargo new</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Say <code>cargo new --bin myprogram</code> to create a Rust
program called <code>myprogram</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Say <code>cargo new --lib myprogram</code> to create a Rust
library called <code>myprogram</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to create new programs and libraries from your
IDE.</p></li>
<li><p>In VSCode you can File &#xBB; Open Folder and then navigate to a Rust
directory to open it as a Rust project.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The instructions here can be very similar to the Windows
instructions. Go to <code>https://rustup.rs</code> to install Rust,
install whatever IDE / Editor and support you want, and off you go.</p>
