# Getting Started Learning Rust
Bart Massey 2025-01

Here's how you can get started on learning Rust in
preparation for our upcoming Rust course.

1. Take a look at the provided instructions for
   setting up with Rust: **Starting Rust on Windows**.

2. Go to *The Rust Programming Language*
   https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ and work through
   Chapters 1-3. While doing this, work through the
   *Rustlings* https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
   exercises on `variables`, `functions`, and `primitive_types`.

3. This course will be taught from material including
   
   * *The Rust Programming Language*
     [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) by Klabnik,
     Nichols *et al*.

   * Google *Comprehensive Rust* [course
     notes](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/) by
     Geissler *et al*.
   
   * `teach-rs` [course
     notes](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/teach-rs)
     Henk Oordt *et al*.
   
   * My [course notes](https://github.com/pdx-cs-rust/rust-course-notes)

   Quickly skim these if you like.

   Use *Programming Rust* by Blandy, Orendorff *et al* as a
   course textbook (the ebook works great).

4. Check out the attached course prospectus. (Plans may
   change on the fly depending on what people want and how
   they are doing â€” this is a prospectus only.)
